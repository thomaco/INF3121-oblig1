\section{\textit{Requirement 1} - Description, analysis and test cases}

\subsection{Description}
We are going to review the program Hangman, which derives its name from the game, written in the language Java. The program consists of 5 source files, namely;
\begin{itemize}
\item Command.java
\item FileReadWriter.java
\item Game.java
\item HangmanTets.java
\item Players.java
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Command.java} only contains an enumerated type, which contains the possible commands for the program. \textbf{FileReadWriter.java} contains the logic for reading from and writing player objects to file for the scoreboard functionality, as well as a method for sorting and printing the scoreboard. \textbf{Game.java} contains the logic for the game itself, which means handling out, user input, checking input and printing the game dialogue. \textbf{HangmanTets.java} only initializes and starts the Game.java logic. \textbf{Players.java} contains the data structure for a player, as well as methods for fetching name and score.

\subsection{Analysis of the testable parts of the program\newline}
\textit{I.E - what can be tested?\newline}
%this can be tested:
\subsubsection{White-box testing}
\textbf{Unit tests}%check functions for each of the files and what they "promise"
\begin{itemize}
\item Players.java
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\textit{Player initialization and declaration variables}
\end{enumerate}


\item Game.java
\item FileReadWriter.java
%\item Command.java

%\item HangmanTets.java
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Integration tests}



\subsubsection{Black-box testing}
\textbf{System testing\newline}

%Just check if the whole thing run together

\textbf{Regression testing}%applied after changes to code that worked, and checks if it still performs correctly.

\subsection{Design of manual system tests}

\section{Conclusion}
make a couple of remarks about how easy or not it was for you to maintain the code
(to modify it in order to improve it). Is there anything that you would have done differently on
the ini'al code to make its maintenance easier?
